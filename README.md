# TE-molecular-feature
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks used to explore transposable elements' (TE) molecular features that are associated with TE immunogenicity in human and mouse colorectal tumors.
- sequence convergence
	+ alignment of forward sequence to compare sequence similarity
	+ alignment with complement and reverse-complement to explore the potential of RNA-binding between elements
- TE integration age
